# Project-1-Currencies

## Objective: 

Calculating the variance of different world leading currencies and highlight events with visualization using USD as the baseline.

Purpose:

This will help financial institutions predict the outcome of certain currency moves based on historical data and lead them to better manage their funds and risk.  

Background:

Analysis of trends and history is essential in order to gather a meaningful interpretation of events. In foreign currency investment, variance analysis in relation to the USD reveals insightful information about trends in foreign currency. Variance, or exchange rate variance as it applies to this project, was used as it indicates the cost to exchange one currency for another. For buyers of foreign currency, a higher variance is advantageous since each dollar converted yields a greater amount of the foreign currency. 

Aside from variance, interest rate information on these currencies are important to understand as well. Higher interest rates for instance can cause the exchange rate to rise since it would attract foreign capital. 

USD as Baseline:

Data: 

Through websites like "Kaggle.com" and "Worldbank.org", our group pulled data exchange rate data for 16 currencies. Data was collected from 1950 to 2022 for all currencies except the Russian Ruble and the EU Euro (which began in 1993 and 1995 respectively). 

Installations: 

Monte Carlo (MC) - The simulation is used to determine total possible outcomes when there exists a potential for random variables influencing the outcomes. In this project, MC would
